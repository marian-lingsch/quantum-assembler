# Towards Quantum Assembler

This git repository contains the code in order to reproduce the results presented in the following [Paper](To be published). The quantum simulator is based upon this [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.11042.pdf), with a [git repository](https://github.com/marian-lingsch/qc-simulators) for the code, which has been adapted in the file [db_simulator.py](src/db_simulator.py).  

The main file can be run in order to reproduce the results, while multiple tests allow to see further programs and their functionality.
